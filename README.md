# rspr 
A tool runs a stochastic simulation in parallel and guarantee numerical reproducibility

rspr is Running a stochastique Simulation in Parallel, ensuring numerical ReproducibilityÂ 

+ A require for this tool: Install hwloc before runs it
https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/

+ This rspr is tested with a simple stochastic simulation of growth of population.
